## Overview

This project focuses on building a robust image classification model using Python and popular machine learning libraries. The model is designed to classify images into different categories based on the features learned during training. The project showcases the end-to-end pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of images labeled into specific categories. Each image is preprocessed and used to train the model. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and testing sets.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow/Keras

You can install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow 
```
## Usage
- Clone the repository:
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/Aryan22145/Machine-Learning.git
```
- Navigate to the project directory:
```bash 
cd Machine-Learning/Image\ Classification
```
- Open the Jupyter notebook:
```
jupyter notebook Image\ Classification.ipynb
```
- Run the cells in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
